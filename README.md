This is a collaboration project developed by Pawel Adamczuk and Jakub Pamula for databases class at Jagiellonian University in 2016. 
It is a simplified fast food restaurant management system made in Visual C#. It requires a working MS SQL database to function correctly.
It is not being developed any more, this repo is merely an archive.
